- **Tonal diversification**: Added 8 Aftermath-only entries without time_pressure dependency
- **New entries focus**: Delayed consequences, information revelation, social/political fallout
- **Tag emphasis**: information, opportunity, social_friction, consequence, terrain
- **Severity**: All new entries 1-5 band (mostly 1-3)
- **Expected impact**: Reduce time_pressure dominance in Aftermath from ~60% to ~40%

- Engage: 18-22 events
- Aftermath: 18 events (post v0.1 expansion)

**Environment Coverage**: All core environments supported with balanced content pools
